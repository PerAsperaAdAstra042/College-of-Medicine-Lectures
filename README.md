## Why Org Mode?
There are many formats to write these lectures in such as Markdown, HTML, LaTeX, and more. The reason Org Mode was chosen is because it is extremely versatile and powerful. Org Mode includes virtually all the features of Markdown and HTML, and can export to various file formats including Markdown, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, etc. In this way, the lectures need to be written only once and then they may be exported to any format necessary anytime with GNU Emacs.

## Why The GFDL-1.3 License?
A lot of these lectures are available free of charge in various places. However, they are not free as in freedom (or libre, that is). These lectures are licensed under the GFDL-1.3 so they may remain free of charge and be freely used in any context necessary. In addition, the GFDL-1.3 is a copyleft license, meaning any possible edits, additions, and improvements will be propagated back to the source, which will help improve these lectures greatly. This is important to ensure that they are complete and sane, with as least mistakes and problems as possible.

## Why  Write These Lectures?
To be able to synthesize what one studies into a complete text by relying on their own understanding is one of the most powerful ways to "carve" the material into the brain. That way, not only does one learn, but they also help others who may find use from this for their own learning as a resource.
